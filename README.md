# Traffic Flow Modeling

A project that simulates realistic traffic flow dynamics using various modeling techniques, including cellular automata, car-following models, and partial differential equations (PDEs). The project aims to analyze and optimize traffic flow by simulating different densities and driver behaviors.

## Project Overview

This project models traffic flow under different conditions to study how variations in traffic density, driver behavior, and road conditions impact flow dynamics. Through simulations, this model identifies optimal density levels and behavioral parameters that can help in reducing congestion and improving road traffic management.

## Features

•	Implementation of various traffic flow models (e.g., cellular automata, car-following models, PDEs).
•	Simulations across varying traffic densities and conditions.
•	Data visualization to analyze flow dynamics, optimal density, and behavioral impacts.
•	Parameter optimization to align model output with real-world traffic patterns.

## Project Structure

•	models&simulations/: Scripts to run simulations for various scenarios.
•	visualizations/: Tools to create charts and graphs for analyzing model outputs.
